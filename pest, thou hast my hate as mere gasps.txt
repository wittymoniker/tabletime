	Pest, Thou hast berated for too long and nilleth hast you hold;
for after thine petty accoutrements had been torn for your navalries of pessimism for mine as escort;
thine trousers had let blood as cause of your cacophonous dissonance.
And that you had but once to burden my liquors and ropes with urgency so ineffective as my jesters;
Inconsiderate as you fail to kneel for my requests at the pantry.

	There is no logic in tongue or addendum for as thusly tainted breath;
As I speak only to reserve my validation on the claim thine hath mistaken me;
Thine speech was so tedious, I thought thou a host to ill intentions.
As pertinence that you had let down your efforts and forget the grasp to my supplement;
I had my pursuit far before deciding to imprison and challenge you at digression with her as of course it is my words to your issue by limerick;


	Pest, thou hast my hate as mere gasps of dislike of you;
thine escorts doth whisked never to make our comments thereat;
but as i sippeth the wine; should thine rat escape from my battlements;
for thou hast parasitic mannerism; and thine limericks stalleth;  
mine recitations are of servience to moonlight; my weapon is yours 
Worry myself to take my rapier to at convenient candle? Not without a flame.
I speaketh not a word; the body doth forgiving; tho it's yours:
So my weapon beneath dost now doth possess that due greatest shining tonight as it always does;
So what is this behemoth of a standhold as of their own; its father or even some servants to my stealth?
So the elixir of sodom; unlikely as she had upheld to it she had sunk; knoweth as it so accepted i did come.
